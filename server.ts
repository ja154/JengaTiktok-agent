// This file is no longer used.
// All server-side logic, including post scheduling, storage, and AI interaction,
// has been moved to the client-side service (`src/services/geminiService.ts`).
// This architectural change was made to resolve persistent "Failed to fetch"
// errors by removing the dependency on a separate, running Node.js server process.
// The application is now fully self-contained and runs entirely in the browser.
